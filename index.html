    <h3>Aida Tarrah, FrontEnd Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
    <span></span> I started this bootcamp to learn coding and become a FrontEnd Developer. I am so excited to learn fundamentals in coding. It's been so interesting and the class is answering all quastions I had in my mind. I am using Windows 10.

    <p>
      <span></span>  I had difficulties for installing Grunt. Finally, I was able to install it. Also, it is hard for me to unsrestand how to clone Github, shell, and Atom. And, I tried to get the cheapest version of Dreamhost, i noticed they charged me for 3 years. So, I am communicating with the support team. i found this confusing too. :D I am sure when I get used to them they are going to be a piece of cake:). Hopefully!
